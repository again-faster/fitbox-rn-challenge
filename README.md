## The Challenge

This code challenge will test your:

- Ability to think on the spot
- Logical thought processes
- Communication skills and ability to talk through your code with others

The coding challenge is designed with the expectation that it can be completed within a set period. It's important to note that completing the task is not mandatory for a successful interview, but the extra effort put into attempting to complete it is acknowledged and valued.

## Prerequisites

A Project bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app/blob/main/README.md).

## Writing Your Code

For this exam, we will be utilizing [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as our primary backend source. You are expected to perform data fetching operations from this source as needed.

### Objective:

The test involves developing two screens:

1. **User List Screen**: A display of users in a scrollable list view.
2. **User Profile Screen**: A detailed view showing the user's profile and their posts.

### Creativity and Innovation:

We encourage you to demonstrate your creativity in designing these screens. Feel free to select any libraries that you prefer for styling and enhancing the user interface. The goal is to deliver an exceptional user experience, and we believe in your technical prowess and innovation to achieve this.

### Instructions:

- Your implementation should showcase effective fetch operations from jsonplaceholder.
- Prioritize user experience and interface design.
- The choice of libraries for styling and layout is left to your discretion. Use this opportunity to showcase your skills in creating engaging and intuitive UIs.

### Expectations:

This exam is not just about testing your coding skills but also your ability to innovate and design user-centric solutions. We look forward to seeing how you leverage the tools and libraries available to create something truly impressive.

Good luck, and have fun with this challenge! We are excited to see what you come up with.

## State Management (Optional)

State management is a plus but it is optional. Use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) if you can.

## Submission Guidelines

NB. Please note that it is mandatory to host your code on your personal repository. Upon completing the challenge, kindly push your commits to your repository and share the corresponding link with us.
